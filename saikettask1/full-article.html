        Flowers have been used for centuries to convey emotions, messages, and meanings. <br> hidden language, known as floriography, became especially popular during the Victorian era, where people used flowers to express sentiments they couldnâ€™t say aloud. Each flower holds a special meaning, from love and friendship to sorrow and mystery.<br>


<h1><b>the floriography</b></h1>  
The idea of flowers carrying meaning dates back to ancient civilizations like Egypt, Greece, and China.</p><br> However, it flourished in the Victorian era (19th century) when strict social rules made open emotional expression difficult. <br> People used bouquets, known as "tussie-mussies," to send coded messages.

For example, a red rose meant passionate love, while a yellow rose could symbolize jealousy or friendship (depending on the era and context).<br>
